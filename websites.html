<p>I’m choosing WWW.NFL.COM I chose this website just off the simple fact that the best thing in the world to me is Football. This site right here has everything I need when it comes to covering the national football league. I could get on this website to check fantasy, live scores, highlights ,etc. they have different tabs for everything so its not necessarily hard to find exactly what your looking for on any given day. They also do use tables and what sets them apart from other websites everything is just an easy find like nothing hiden everything is visible and I like how they created the site. The colors are kind of very basic red white blue and grey. Its very easy to scroll thru up and down pages.</p>
 
 
<p>Im also choosing WWW.HUDL.COM I pick this website just off the strength that use it a lot. Being a college athlete we use it literally everyday to watch film and also communicate with our coaches. The coding on this website is very clean and they do use HTML 5 elements. I think the layout makes a lot of sense but I feel like they could fix some stuff honestly like I be having promblems with the scrolling at times. So if its hard to navigate the scrolling its not always easy to navigate through so it may be confusing at times. They use two really different colors orange and white but it be black when your actually watching film. Things that set this site apart are that you cant use any other website to watch film like this and how far back its dated.</p>
 
 
<p>I website that I don’t like is www.ncaa.org its very hard to use then the search button that they have it never really searches up what your actually looking for. They do use HTML 5 elements on there website but I just don’t like it. There scrolling effect for me could be more fluent and more easy to use. It easy to navigate up and down but its hard to navigate side to side. The colors they use are white in blue on the ncaa sign black on the header and red and white on there huge COVID sign. </p>
